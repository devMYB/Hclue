Demo of the idea: 

It is a creative personal skill activity which is done for a group of people. The aim is to convert this idea into an app. 

You will be given a question (input by a person who is conducting this) like “How can we make better content?”, for which the participants will leave their ideas, the ideas are given in a way of either a word or a sentence, and later that will be placed as a post it note on a big dashboard anonymously. A person can leave as many ideas as they want but it will be one idea per post it note. This phase will be done for 5-10 mins, with smooth background music. Later once all the ideas are listed, it will take a minute or two to set the dashboards with all the ideas presented. Later all the participants will be given 5 to 30 mins (based on no.of ideas) to go through the ideas. Later the participants will be given 5 votes each with 1-5 points where 5 points is the highest and later will be given 5 minutes to vote on all the ideas presented. Once this phase is completed, we will have an integrated AI that will go through the ideas and organize the similar ideas in groups/themes. From this the highest rated ideas will then be developed as a project and then they will be converted into action items which makes the ideas applicable ultimately acting on the question. In this process while reading if an idea is reported as ambiguous by a large group, then only, we reach out to the person who submitted the idea to explain their thought more clearly otherwise the ideas will be anonymous.  

 

Project Resource Document: Collaborative Ideation Platform 

Executive Summary 

 

IdeaFlow is a digital platform that transforms traditional brainstorming sessions into a structured, efficient, and anonymous ideation process. The platform guides participants through five key phases: 

Idea Submission: Participants anonymously submit ideas as digital "post-it notes" in response to a central question 

Idea Review: All ideas are displayed on a shared dashboard for group review 

Voting: Participants allocate weighted votes (1-5 points) to identify the most promising ideas 

AI Analysis: An integrated AI system automatically organizes similar ideas into themes 

Action Planning: High-rated ideas are converted into actionable project plans 

This platform eliminates common brainstorming pitfalls (dominant voices, groupthink, lack of follow-through) while promoting inclusive participation and efficient conversion of ideas into action. Designed primarily for corporate environments, IdeaFlow creates a safe space for innovation while ensuring the best ideas rise to the top through democratic evaluation.
